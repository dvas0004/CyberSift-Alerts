#OS User logged in using new Oracle DB User
##Description
An OS User logged in with a DB User that they had not previously used.

It is important to make the distinction between the Oracle audit concepts of "Current User" and "DB User".

The "DB User" is the Oracle account with which the user has logged into the DBMS in the session in question.
The "Current User" is the Oracle account whose privileges are currently in effect.

For example: If a user is logged into the DBMS with "Account A", and runs an SQL command, both the DB User and Current User would be "Account A".
If a user on the other hand logged into the DBMS with "Account A" and ran a stored procedure owned by "Account B" (and thus having that account's privileges), the DB User would still be "Account A",
but the "Current User" would be set to "Account B" as the stored procedure will have run with that user's privileges.

### Possible causes of false positives
- Currently, these alerts are not distinguishing between "Current User" and "DB User", and are firing when it is only the "Current User" which is unusual.
Thus we are receiving these alerts when an OS user logs with a normal DB User, and then runs a stored procedure owned by a user which is "unusual".
